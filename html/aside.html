<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p>

<aside>
<p>The Epcot center is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.</p>

<p>  It was fantasic.  The kids enjoyed it the adults enoyed it.
</p>
<p>If only they didn't constantly assault you with things to buy.  Could it be more commercialized. </p>
